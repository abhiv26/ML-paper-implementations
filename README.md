Advanced Topics on Deep Learning. In this class, we read research papers on the latest deep learning trends, such as DeepSeek LLM, V2, V3, Janus, VL/VL2, etc. Some of these papers reference older papers like CLIP, ViT, GPT-2, etc. When I have the time, I like to implement some of the papers I read, both new and old.

**Note:** Github is unable to render my notebooks, and I am currently working on a solution for that. In the meantime, to view the notebooks, use [nbviewer.org](https://nbviewer.org/). Just paste the URL of any notebook in the repo into nbviewer.
